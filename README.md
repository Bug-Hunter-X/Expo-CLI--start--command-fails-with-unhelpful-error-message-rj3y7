# Expo CLI 'start' command fails with unhelpful error message

This repository demonstrates a common problem encountered when using the Expo CLI's `start` command.  The command fails to start the development server, providing only a vague error message, making debugging challenging.  This issue is not related to errors in the application code itself, but rather to environment or project configuration problems. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the root directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the generic error message.

## Potential Solutions

* **Check your environment:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm or yarn properly installed and configured.
* **Update Expo CLI:** Use `expo upgrade` to update to the latest version.
* **Clean your project:** Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling dependencies.
* **Check Expo config:** Review your `app.json` or `expo.json` for any configuration issues. 
* **Check your network connection:**  Make sure you have a stable internet connection.
